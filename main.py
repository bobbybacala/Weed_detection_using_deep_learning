    Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our aim is to help in identifying crop diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system is major part accurate with Validation Accuracy being **93%** using machine learning techniques.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and check results.

    ### About Us
    Learn more about the our team on the **About** page.

                #### About the Technique
                We used Convolutional Neural Network to train our model on training data, Convolutional neural networks, also known as CNNs, are a specific type of neural networks that are generally composed of the following layers:
                1. **Convolution layer (CONV):** The convolution layer (CONV) uses filters that perform convolution operations as it is scanning the input I with respect to its dimensions. Its hyperparameters include the filter size F and stride S.
                The resulting output O is called feature map or activation map.
                2. **Pooling (POOL):** The pooling layer (POOL) is a downsampling operation, typically applied after a convolution layer, which does some spatial invariance.
                3. **Connection Layer:** The fully connected layer (FC) operates on a flattened input where each input is connected to all neurons.
                #### About Crop Dataset
                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.The original dataset can be found on Kaggle and is contributed by **@vipoooool**(Samir Bhattarai).
                This dataset consists of about 24K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 13 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing 21 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
                #### Crop Dataset Content
                1. train (24055 images)
                2. test (21 images)
                3. validation (6014 images)
                #### About Weed Dataset
                This dataset majorly has been collected from roboflow and later structured into a train, test, and validation set by us.
                This dataset consists of about 1000 rgb images of different kinds of weeds which is categorized into 7 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 70/20/10 ratio of training, validation and testing set preserving the directory structure.
                #### Weed Dataset Content
                1. train (628 images)
                3. validation (244images)
                2. test (89 images)
